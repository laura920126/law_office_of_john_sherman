        "question": "Do I need an attorney for a divorce in Florida?",
        "answer": "While Florida law does not strictly require an attorney, navigating the legal system alone can be risky, especially if assets or children are involved. A divorce agreement is a binding court order; undoing mistakes later is often impossible or extremely costly."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much does a consultation cost?",
        "answer": "I offer a free initial consultation for all personal injury cases. For family law matters, I offer a preliminary case evaluation to determine if we are the right fit for your situation before any retainers are discussed."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I do immediately after a car accident?",
        "answer": "First, ensure your safety and seek medical attention immediately, even if you feel fine. Call the police to get a report. Document the scene with photos if possible. Crucially, do not sign anything or accept a settlement from an insurance company without speaking to an attorney first."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is child custody determined in Florida?",
        "answer": "Florida courts determine timesharing based on the \"best interests of the child.\" This involves evaluating roughly 20 statutory factors, including the mental and physical health of parents, the child's established routine, and the ability of each parent to facilitate a relationship with the other parent."
